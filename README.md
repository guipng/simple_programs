# simple_programs
In this repository, I am going to add some .py files I made to display some simple programs based on Al Sweigart's book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python". Some programs are examples from the book, but I also added programs of my own.

### gauss.py
This program is just for a small test using a "for loop" to solve a problem of adding all numbers from 1 to 100.

"range" concepts were applied.

### guess_game.py
I imported the "random" library to create a program that draws a number from 1 to 20.

The user has 6 attempts to guess what number this is.

"range" concepts were applied.

## jokenpo.py
Now this is a slightly more complete program and with a more interesting use of the "random" library.

It's a jokenpo game where the player plays against cpu.

## tictactoe.py
Based on jokenpo.py, I decided to make this game with the knowledge I have at the moment.

I decided to apply functions to make the program easier to read and organize.

It seemed interesting and easy to create a tictactoe game. But honestly, it was a challenge to think about how everything could work in an automated way. There's still room for improvement, but it's working really well.

And that's a 2 player game, no CPU.
